                + what
                    - WCF is the name of the API designed specifically for the process of building distributed system;

                + why
                    - unlike specific distributed APIs, u might have used in the past(DCOM, .NET remoting, XML web services, message queueing), WCF provides a single, unified, and extendable programming object MODEL that u an use to interact with a number of previously diverse distributed technologies;


                + aspects of WCF
                    - interoperability
                    - integration

                    - support for strongly typed as well as untyped messages;

                    - support for several bindings(e.g., raw HTTP, TCP, MSMQ, WebSockets, named pipes) allows u to choose the most appropriate plumbing to transport message data;

                    - support for the latest-and-greatest web service specifications

                    - a fully integrated security model encompassing both native windows/.NET security protocols and numerous neutral-security techniques built on web service standards;

                    - support for session-like state management techniques, as well as support for one-way or stateless message;
