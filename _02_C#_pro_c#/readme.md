# pro CSharp

I wanna be a pro C# programmer.

after finished basic C# programming tour, i found it is not easy to do what I want in other langs like C/C++, Python, VB/VBA etc.

I want sharp my skilled and understand concepts beyond the basic of C#.

This is the way.

motion before emotion.
